# weather-on-demand

This project consists of a simple weather dashboard that uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for searched cities. Users are able to search for a city and be presented with current and future (5-day) conditions for the city. The city is added to the search history and can be cleared. Users are able to view the UV index and have a color code of green-favorable conditions, yellow/orange-moderate conditions, and red-severe conditions. Users are able to click on city names saved in the search history via local storage, and be presented with the city they have clicked on.
